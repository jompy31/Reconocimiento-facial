## About the program:

- All about me is at **[My Website](https://jompy31.github.io/)**

- Librerias: `Open CV (is a free computer vision library originally developed by Intel) Numpy (is a library for the Python programming language that supports creating large multidimensional arrays and vectors) dlib (is a modern C++ toolkit that contains machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++)`

## Instructions

1. Installing requirements: Make sure you have started a new Python project and then install the libraries: If you use pipenv like I do, you can install them all with the following command: `pipenv install opencv-python, dlib` - `pip install numpy`
2. Load and render an image: We are simply loading the image with imread, and then tell OpenCV to render the image in a name, this will open the window and give it a title.
3. Facial recognition: with Dlib call get_frontal_face_detector() Very intuitive. There is a caveat though, this function will only work with grayscale images, so we'll need to do that with OpenCV first. The get_frontal_face_detector() will be returned to a detector that is a function that we can use to retrieve the face information. Each face is an object that contains the points where the image can be found.
4. Identification of facial features: with the function called shape_predictor() this will perform the identification of facial features, but it requires a little help, it needs a pre-trained model to work.
